# Neural Network Challenge

## Prepare the Data

The X and y is separated in order to train the model. The features are then split into training and testing. 
Then the data is scaled so each feature can be evaluated evenly among the various features. 


## Compile and Evaluate the Model

This section creates the model and adds layers. It then runs the model and checks the accuracy of each epoch. 

## Evaluate the Model

This checks the accuracy of the entire model. 

## Save and Export

This saves the data so that it can easily be imported in the future.


## Predict Loan Repayment

This section reloads from the saved data. Then it makes predictions and adds them to a data frame. Then a summary of the predictions is displayed.
